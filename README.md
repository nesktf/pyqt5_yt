# PyQT YouTube Client
A simple YouTube frontend I made back in 2021 for a college assigment using Qt5 and mpv.

It probably doesn't work anymore :p

## Dependencies
```sh
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

If you are using Windows, drop your `mpv.exe` and `yt-dlp.exe` inside `resources/mpv`. Otherwise
just install mpv using your package manager.
